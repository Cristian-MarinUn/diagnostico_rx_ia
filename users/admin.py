from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
# NOTE: 2FA models (TwoFactorAuth, TwoFactorCode, LoginAttempt) will be added to users/models.py later
# For now, this admin file is kept minimal to avoid import errors.

# TODO: Implement 2FA admin classes once models are defined in users/models.py
